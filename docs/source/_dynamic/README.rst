Dicomhandler is a Python tool for integrating `DICOM <https://www.dicomstandard.org/>`_ information and processing DICOM radiotherapy structures. It allows to modify the structures (expand, contract, rotate, translate) and to obtain statistics from these modifications without the need to use CT or MRI images and to create new objects with this information, which are compatible with the commercial systems of treatment planning such as `Eclipse <https://www.varian.com/es/products/radiotherapy/treatment-planning/eclipse>`_ and `Brainlab Elements <https://www.brainlab.com/es/productos-de-cirugia/relacion-de-productos-de-neurocirugia/brainlab-elements/>`_. It is possible to extract the information from the structures in an easy *csv-able* form.

Dicomhandler uses DICOM files that belongs to different stages of treatment planning (structures, dose, and plan), by grouping the files of a patient in a single object. DICOM objects have to be created with `Pydicom <https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/>`_. Also, it allows for the extraction of related information, such as the Cartesian coordinates of structures and multileaf collimator (MLC) positions for each control point in the treatment plan. This is achieved by using the ``DicomInfo`` class. It receives as input the DICOM radiotherapy structures (RS), dose (RD), and plan (RP) files (or a subset of these) and constructs a single object that contains all the information for a patient.

Dicomhandler is built on `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_. NumPy provides an efficient implementation of numerical computations in a high-level language like Python but completely compiled in C, resulting in a significant improvement in speed and code that is clear and easy to maintain.

Features
--------

The functionalities provided by the package could be divided into three main categories.


* 
  **File transformation:** To modify the files’ information in some
  meaningful way.

* 
  **Format conversion:** DICOM files are neither optimized for data analysis, nor straightforward review by clinical staff, but for hardware. For that reason, the package provides means for both scientific manipulation of data and effortless conversion to clinical-friendly formats.

* 
  **Report data:** To summarize different DICOM files, or even about the comparison between files.

Examples
--------

Register DICOM files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is required to operate on a DICOM object by `Pydicom <https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/>`_. You can use the DICOM files examples by default in the `repository <https://github.com/alxrojas/dicom2handle/tree/main/Examples>`_\ ).

You can construct an object with different DICOM files from the same patient as:

.. code-block:: python

   di = DicomInfo(dicom_structure, dicom_plan)

Anonymize the information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can choose the information that it has to be anonymized:

.. code-block:: python

   di.anonymize(name=True, birth=True, operator=False, creation=False)

Expand or contract margins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can expand or subtract margins for a single structure. If you want to expand, the input parameter must be positive. Otherwise, negative.

.. code-block:: python

   expanded = di.add_margin('5 GTV', 1.5)
   contracted = di.add_margin('5 GTV', -1.5)

Rotate or translate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can `rotate <https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch,_yaw,_and_roll>`_ or `translate <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix>`_ a structure (organ or lesion) in an specific direction with respect to an arbitary point or to the isocentre. The keys are: roll, pitch, and yaw (for rotations) and x, y, and z (for translations).

For the isocenter:

.. code-block:: python

   di_rotated = di.move('5 GTV', 0.5, 'pitch')
   di_translated = di.move('5 GTV', 1.0, 'x')

Or for an arbritary point:

.. code-block:: python

   di_rotated = di.move('5 GTV', 0.5, 'pitch', [4.0, -50.0, 20.0])
   di_translated = di.move('5 GTV', 1.0, 'x', [4.0, -50.0, 20.0])

Summary in dataframe
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A dataframe is generated with the main information of the plan, relevant for clinical statistics. Also, you can obtain the calculated areas of multileaf collimator (MLC) modulation.

To obtain general plan information:

.. code-block:: python

   di.summarize_to_dataframe(area=False)

To obtain the MLC areas:

.. code-block:: python

   di.summarize_to_dataframe(area=True)

CSV files
^^^^^^^^^

A csv file is generated with some information.

Structures
~~~~~~~~~~

 The output file provides the information on the coordinates (x, y, z) of all or some structures of a patient. By default the report is generated for all structures.

For all structures this process takes several minutes.

.. code-block:: python

   di.struct_to_csv(path_or_buff='output.csv')

Or you can select some structures to obtain the csv file in a particular path:

.. code-block:: python

   di.struct_to_csv(path_or_buff='output.csv', names=['Structure1', 'Structure2'])

Or in buffer:

.. code-block:: python

   di.struct_to_csv(path_or_buff=StringIO(), names=['Structure1', 'Structure2'])

Also, the output file can provide the information of gantry angle, gantry direction, table angles, and MLC positions for each checkpoint.

.. code-block:: python

   di.mlc_to_csv(path_or_buff="output.csv")

Or in buffer:

.. code-block:: python

   di.mlc_to_csv(path_or_buff=StringIO())

Access
------

We encourage the practice of using virtual environments to avoid dependency incompatibilities. The most convenient way to do this, is by using virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper, and pip.

Install with pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After setting up and activating the virtualenv, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install dicomhandler

Install the development version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case you’d like to be able to update the package code occasionally with the latest bug fixes and improvements, see the source code, or even make your own changes, you can always clone the code directly from the repository:

.. code-block:: console

   git clone https://github.com/alxrojas/dicomhandler
   cd dicomhandler
   pip install -e .

Open and run the project
